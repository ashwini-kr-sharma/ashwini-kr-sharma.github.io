My research focused on identifying the enhancer-driven regulatory subtypes in Neuroblastoma and understanding its developmental origins.\nI did my doctoral research at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Hans Knöll Institute (HKI). My research focussed on the reprogramming of the metabolic landscape in tumors.\nI have a Masters degree in Genomics from the Madurai Kamraj University, India and a Bachelors degree in Biotechnology from Vellore Institute of Technology, India.\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nNext generation sequencing data analysis - I have extensive experience working with data generated with: scRNAseq, RNAseq, CHIPseq, ATACseq, HiC, Micro-array, 450/850K methylation array etc\nGenome scale and Arrayed Perturbation screening data analysis - Hit Identification, Knockout mechanism of action, Perturbation signature scoring etc\nDisease heritability and GWAS enrichment - sLDSC, MAGMA, scLinker etc\nSingle cell transcriptomics analysis - QC, cell type identification, trajectory inference, cell markers, transcriptional activity etc\nAnalyses of large public -omic datasets - generated by consortiums like TCGA, GTeX, ENCODE, BLUEPRINT, DepMap etc\nMulti -omic data integration - Biological pathway analysis, Regulatory networks, Biomarker discovery, scoring molecular signatures in disease cohorts and associating it to clinical outcomes, Data visualization etc\nMachine Learning - Unsupervised and Supervised learning, Classification and Feature selection (using R packages like caret, glmnet etc)\nReproducible research - Git, Rmarkdown, Plotly, ShinyApps, Snakemake, Docker\nCloud Computing - Open Stack, Google Cloud\nCoding/Tools - R statistical programming, Bash, Bioconductor, Conda\nDomain knowledge of tumor biology, molecular biology, metabolism, biochemistry and (epi-)genomics\nMulti -omic data analysis – RNAseq, Microarray, 450/850K methylation array, CHIPseq, ATACseq etc\nExperience in analysing high throughput screening datasets\nExperience with single-cell technologies, especially scRNA-seq\nMachine Learning with focus on classification, regression and feature selection problems\nExperience in handling data from TCGA, GTeX, ENCODE, DepMap, Human cell atlas etc\nScoring of molecular phenotypes using established gene signatures\nIdentification of molecular signatures in disease cohorts and associating it to clinical outcomes\nRunning and maintaining established NGS pipelines\nBiological pathway analysis, Biomarker discovery, Pattern recognition, Data visualisation etc\nData interpretation, quality control, result documentation and effective communication\nR statistical programming, Bioconductor, Bash, Github, Snakemake, Rmarkdown, Shiny, Docker\nSome experience in cloud computing - OpenStack\n\n\n\nInterpersonal Skills\nMost of my projects were carried out in close collaboration with experimental or clinical groups. Thus, I have the necessary experience in managing and working in multidisciplinary teams. Furthermore, my academic background was in experimental biology while my professional background is in computational biology which has made me a good intermediary who can bridge and communicate across diverse experts in interdisciplinary projects."
