::: {#bio}
I am a Computational Biology Scientist at [GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/). 

In over 10 years as a computational biologist, my work has broadly revolved around using statistical and computational tools to understand disease causing mechanisms by integrating data generated using various genomic and epi-genomic technologies.
