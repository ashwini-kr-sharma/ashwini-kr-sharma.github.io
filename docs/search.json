My research focused on identifying the enhancer-driven regulatory subtypes in Neuroblastoma and understanding its developmental origins.\nI did my doctoral research at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Hans Knöll Institute (HKI). My research focussed on the reprogramming of the metabolic landscape in tumors.\nI have a Masters degree in Genomics from the Madurai Kamraj University, India and a Bachelors degree in Biotechnology from Vellore Institute of Technology, India.\n\n\n\nManagement Skills\n\nCross-functional team leadership: I have worked in Matrix teams across multiple projects as the Computational Biology project lead\nStrategic planning & Project Management: I have contributed to wet-lab experiment design involving downstream bioinformatics analysis, planned for Computational Biology experiments, talent resourcing, and timelines across projects\nStakeholder management: I have communicated key high-level insights to senior leaders and decision makers to impact broader company vision and direction.\nScientific communication: All my projects have involved communicating Computational Biology derived insights to non-experts in interdisciplinary projects to impact decision making\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nNext generation sequencing data analysis: Data generated with genomic and epi-genomic technologies like: scRNAseq, RNAseq, CHIPseq, ATACseq, HiC, Micro-array, 450/850K methylation array etc\nGenome scale and Arrayed Perturbation screening data analysis - Hit Identification, Mechanism of action, Perturbation signature scoring etc\nMulti -omic data integration and interpretation - Biological pathway analysis, Regulatory networks, Biomarker discovery, scoring molecular signatures in disease cohorts and associating it to clinical outcomes, Data visualization etc\nSingle cell transcriptomics analysis - QC, cell type and cell state identification, cell marker identification, transcriptional activity etc\nDisease heritability and GWAS enrichment - Disease - Mechanism association analyses using statistical genetics methods like sLDSC, MAGMA, scLinker etc\nAnalyses of large public -omic datasets - generated by consortium like TCGA, GTeX, ENCODE, BLUEPRINT, DepMap etc\nMachine Learning - Unsupervised and Supervised learning, Classification and Feature selection (using R packages like caret, glmnet etc)\nReproducible research - Git/Github, Rmarkdown, Plotly, ShinyApps, Snakemake, Docker\nCloud Computing - Open Stack, Google Cloud\nCoding/Tools - R statistical programming, Bash, Bioconductor, Conda"
